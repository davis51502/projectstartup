###Learning in 260


- learned about git status, git pull, git push, git commit, git fetch
    -also about how to style an .md file 

# HTML 
1/15/25
- `<head>` contains things like title, charset, viewport settings
- `<body>` contains the visible page content

1/16/25
## Navigation Best Practices
- Use semantic `<nav>` element for navigation menus
- Navigation links should be in unordered lists `<ul>`

1/17/25
- Relative paths (../pages/index.html) work well for internal links
- Keep navigation consistent across all pages and directories clean so its easy to know where to access changes within files because things get complicated fast
-I am able to work longer when I am more organized

1/18/25
## Common Elements Reviewed
- `<header>` - Contains introductory content/navigation
- `<main>` - Primary content of the page
- `<footer>` - Bottom section with copyright, links etc

1/19/25
- `<section>` - Thematic grouping of content
- `<div>` - Generic container for styling/layout
- Must reference the styles.css to get the changes wanted in the html files
-Its easier to just create a folder for each respective language: html, css, js

sudo systemctl daemon-reload - forces files to be re-read and update its internal state 
sudo systemctl restart caddy - uses the latest settings changed (when I changed :80 to movieratings.click)

- how to implement dropdown filters
- how to use 'useState' and 'useEffect' to mock out login and sign up functionality
- 'useState' is used to manage the login state, user data, and form inputs. 
- 'useEffect' is used to check for stored user data on component mount.

## Introduction to Node.js
- Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside the browser.
- Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- Commonly used for building server-side applications.

## Key Features
- **Asynchronous and Event-Driven**: Handles multiple requests without blocking.
- **Non-blocking I/O**: Efficiently handles file and network operations.
- **Single-Threaded**: Uses a single thread with event looping for concurrency.

## Core Modules
- `fs`: File system operations (read/write files).
- `http`: Create and manage HTTP servers.
- `path`: Work with file and directory paths.
- `os`: Provides information about the operating system.

## Package Management
- Uses npm (Node Package Manager) for managing dependencies.
- Install packages using `npm install <package-name>`.

## Example: Simple HTTP Server
```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello, World!\n');
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running at http://localhost:3000/');
});
```
- Run the server with `node server.js`.
- Access it in the browser at `http://localhost:3000/`.
