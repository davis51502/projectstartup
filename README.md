# Movie Ratings Hub

[My Notes](notes.md)

Movie Ratings Hub is a dynamic web application that brings friends together through their shared love of cinema. Users can rate movies, create personalized watchlists, and discover new films through their friend's recommendations.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Key features

- **Real-time Rating System** - Users can rate movies on a 5-star scale, with ratings instantly visible to all connected users.

- **Watchlist Management** - Keep track of movies you want to watch, organize them into custom lists.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses semantic HTML structure for the application. Six main HTML pages: login, sign up, home, search, chat, profile. Hyperlinks to all pages.

- **CSS** - Clean styling with a focus on movie posters and color scheme. Uses whitespace neatly and a grid layout.

- **React** - Provides authentication, rating system, and profile management. Uses React Router for navigation between pages.

- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  - Login
  - Movie search and details
  - Rating submission
  - Watchlist management
  - Friend connections

- **DB/Login** - Store user profiles, movie ratings, and watchlists in database. Secure registration and login system. Stores encrypted credentials.

- **WebSocket** - Real-time updates when friends rate movies or modify their watchlists.
