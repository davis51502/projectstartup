[My Notes](notes.md)

Movie Ratings Hub is a dynamic web application that brings friends together through their shared love of cinema.

The platform features real-time updates when friends rate movies, making it easy to see what your trusted circle thinks about the latest releases.

You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.
